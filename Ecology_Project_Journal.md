There are a significant number of squirrels everywhere. Walking outside to go to my car in the morning, two were chasing each other in front of me. When I got to work for a meeting, there was a bird flying around the entrance. Animals are often used for examples of words for the purpose of examining data structures storing information, such as `dog` and `cat`. In a couple TV Shows, characters talk about others occasionally with animal metaphors. Phrases like `Elephant in the room` and `Cougar` are used without a second thought because of their use in our English. When I went to dinner, Wurstküche, I ordered a rattlesnake sausage, which was excellent.

Getting breakfast, we went down to Señor G's, and I had a chorizo burrito, which has eggs and pork sausage. On TV, characters both love and hate animals. In an act of mercy, one character put a dog out of its misery after being hit by a car by killing it with his hands. Chicken shows up everywhere in my meals, and its so mass produced that there's practically no way to avoid it.

Not much in the way of animal interactions or conversations.

Campus is full of squirrels running around. They are very comfortable with humans, going so far as to eat from your hand if you're patient enough. More use of animals in coding examples. Carnitas are made up of pork, which I had for a late lunch. Supermarkets are full of animal products. The meat section is always trying to best display their pre-marinated or pre-seasoned meats. This supermarket even had a cooked food buffet, which was packed of meats, everything from eggs and fish to pork and beef.

Animals on campus are too comfortable. We had a small flock of birds coming through the main entrance to the warehouse where I work. There was a smallish animal, probably a raccoon, that was dead on the road, blood and guts smeared all over the road. The burger I ate for a late dinner had a beef patty in it.

Squirrels running around campus as usual. Otherwise an unremarkable day of coding and being inside.
